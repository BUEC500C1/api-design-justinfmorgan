# EC500 Homework 2: API-Design

# Welcome to my Tweepy/Google Vision API!
The API design is fairly simple. Simply run the python program via "python myApi.py 'search term'" and replace 'search term' (keep the quotes) with whatever term you want to scour Twitter for! The program will then output a JSON containing information about the first tweet it found matching that both matched the search term and also contained an image. The JSON will contain the following information: Your search string, the image URL, the tweet text, the tweet URL, and a list of labels outputted by a Google Vision API analysis done on the image.
